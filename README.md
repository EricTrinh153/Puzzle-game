# Puzzle game
- The Constant component I used for declaring the size of the board, grid and total number of tile in the board which I can reuse it in other components like Tiles and Boards
- Having created the controller for managing the swapping function of the puzzle game through getting the position of the matrix with its row and column, getting the visual column, and using the ternary condition to return the shuffle function.
- Using the motion in the react-motion library to create the animation style for the shuffling tiles.
- Using the useState hook to declare the new states named tiles and then the new value of tiles will be changed by setTiles state
- Importing the Board component into the App file and is reusable.
